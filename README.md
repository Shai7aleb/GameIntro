# Introduction
This project is about an animated intro coded in C and rendered using OpenGL. This animation is based off of the intro to the game ["O"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/15945630/) on Scratch. However, I recreated all the models, animations, and code.
Note that this project uses [Lodepng](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) to decode PNG files.

# Requirements
To run this project, you must have Code::Blocks (ideally version 17.12) installed on your machine.
